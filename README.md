# Sustainable-Apparel-Classification

## Problem Statement 

Develop an AI solution using the Fashion MNIST dataset with a focus on identifying and classifying sustainable apparel products in alignment with the company's vision and the provided job description.

## Dataset Description 

**Dataset Link:**  <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist/data'>Fashion MNIST</a> <br> <br>
**Description:** Fashion-MNIST is a dataset comprising 70,000 grayscale images of clothing articles, divided into a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. It features 10 distinct classes and is designed as a direct replacement for the original MNIST dataset, maintaining the same image size and training/testing data division, making it a valuable benchmark for machine learning algorithms. <br>

Each image in Fashion-MNIST is 28x28 pixels, totaling 784 pixels. Each pixel holds a single value representing its lightness or darkness, with a range of 0 to 255. Both training and test data sets consist of 785 columns. The first column contains class labels, identifying the clothing item, while the remaining columns store pixel values associated with the image. To locate a specific pixel in the image, it can be expressed as 'x = i * 28 + j,' with 'i' and 'j' as integers from 0 to 27, referring to the pixel's position in a 28x28 matrix

**Training Set Distribution:**

| Class Label | Class Name | Number of Samples| Distribution |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 0 |  T-shirt/top  | 6000 |  10%  |
| 1 | Trouser | 6000 | 10% |
| 2 | Pullover | 6000 | 10% |
| 3 | Dress | 6000 | 10% |
| 4 | Coat | 6000 | 10% |
| 5 | Sandal | 6000 | 10% |
| 6 | Shirt | 6000 | 10% |
| 7 | Sneaker | 6000 | 10% |
| 8 | Bag | 6000 | 10% |
| 9 | Ankle boot | 6000 | 10% |


**Summary:**
<ul>
  <li> Training set Dimension : <i> 60000x785 </i>, Testing Set Dimension :  <i> 10000x785 </i> </li>
  <li>Each row is a separate image</li>
  <li>Column 1 is the class label.</li>
  <li>Remaining columns are pixel numbers (784 total).</li>
  <li>Each value is the darkness of the pixel (1 to 255)</li>
</ul>
